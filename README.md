Hurriscape


#####Purpose:
This app is designed to help people escape areas where a powerful hurricane is incoming. In these scenarios, people are often caught unprepared, or have no means of transportation to evacuate. In exchage for a "barter item", or just out of good will, users can create ride offers (carpooling) to help unfortunate people leave. The idea also helps alleviate traffic on routes that millions of people are likely to use in the event of a major evacuation by effectively carpooling them.

####Connecting Users:

Users can search by specifying their current origin city and the detination they would like to reach. They can then "apply" to a ride offer by submitting their phone number. The person offering the ride can then get in touch with the applicant to discuss details.
