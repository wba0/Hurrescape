                    <p>This app is designed to help people escape areas where a powerful hurricane is incoming. In these scenarios, people are often
                    caught unprepared, or have no means of transportation to evacuate. In exchage for a "barter item", or just out of good will, users
                    can create ride offers (carpooling) to help unfortunate people leave. The idea also  helps alleviate traffic on routes that millions of people
                    are likely to use in the event of a major evacuation by effectively carpooling them.</p>

                    <p>During the latest hurrican season, I noticed that many people were unable to leave dangerous areas in time because of lack of means of transportation and/or preparedness.
                    This app is also inspired by my nightmares of days-long traffic along a single interstate before an impending direct hit by a
                    powerful hurricane. </p>

              <p>Users can search by specifying their current origin city and the detination they would like to reach. They can then "apply" to a ride offer by submitting their phone number. The person offering the ride can then get in touch with the applicant to discuss details.</p>
